IBM Design Language Color Palette for Tableau Data Visualizations

## üìù Project Description:

Welcome aboard fellow data viz designer, this is where you will find the Tableau Preferences file which contains the colors used in the IBM Design Language Color palette.

As a Data Analyst with a graphic design background, I was less than thrilled with the color options that come baked into Tableau by default. I found many of the color options to lacking in ability to grab attention or be accessible. Tableau also limits users to only 16 Custom Colors inside their Desktop application if they want to use specific hex color codes, and this was simply not enough for this designer. Thus, I set out on a quest to import additional color themes for more beautiful visualizations.

I researched many companies Design Systems, and found [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color) to be one of the best. From there, I edited the Preferences.tps file within Tableau, and added their hex color codes to the settings.

By using this preference file for Tableau, you will have access to the entire library of colors seen within the IBM Design Language color palette.

## üìö How to Install and Use: 

First, navigate to your Tableau Repository, usually located at a similar path if using Windows: 
"C:\Users\yourcomputername\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Preferences.tps"


From there, I would recommend making a backup copy of the original Preferences.tps file. Keep it secret, keep it safe. After you have backed up the original, replace it with this version of the Preferences.tps file.

The next time you launch Tableau, you will see the IDL Colors.

Happy Data Vizzing!
