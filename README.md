IBM Design Language Color Palette for Tableau Data Visualizations

### Project Description:

Welcome aboard fellow data viz designer, this is where you will find the Tableau Preferences file which contains the accessible colors used in the IBM Design Language Color palette.

As a Data Analyst with a graphic design background, I was less than thrilled with the color options that come baked into Tableau by default. I found many of the color options to lack accessibility, or the ability to grab attention. Tableau also limits users to about 16 Custom Colors inside their Desktop application if they want to use specific Hex color codes, and this simple was not enough for this designer. Thus, I set out on a quest to import more color themes I would actually want to use within the software.

I researched many companies Design Systems, and found IBM Design Language to be one of the best. From there, I edited the Preferences file within Tableau, and added their color Hexcodes to the settings.

By using this prefernce file for Tableau, you will have access to the entire library of colors seen within the IBM Design Language colors.

### How to Install and Use: 

First, navigate to your Tableau Repository, usually located at a similar path if using Windows: 
"C:\Users\yourcomputername\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Preferences.tps"


From there, I would recommend making a backup copy of the original Preferences.tps file. After you have backed up the original somewhere safe, replace it with this version of the Preferences.tps file.

The next time you launch Tableau, you will see the IBM Colors.

Happy Data Vizzing!
